# pst

A simple command-line tool to publish short posts to Micro.blog.

This is partially a personal project to learn Rust, but also to build something
that I will use myself. If other people find it useful in any capacity,
then that is a bonus.

## Functionality

- [x] publish drafts to Micro.blog
- [x] configure app token in config.json
- [ ] usage instructions
- [ ] control post status via argument
- [ ] maybe support input from stdin
- [ ] better output when publishing post
